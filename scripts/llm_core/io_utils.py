"""
LLM Core Input/Output Utilities Module.

This module will handle common I/O operations such as saving LLM responses,
confirming steps with the user, and parsing specific content from responses.
Functions like save_llm_response, confirm_step, parse_pr_content,
and parse_summaries_from_response from llm_interact.py will be moved here.
Basic logging or user interaction helpers might also reside here.
"""
# I/O utility functions will be implemented here in subsequent refactoring steps.
