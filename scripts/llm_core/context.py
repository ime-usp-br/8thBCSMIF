LLM Core Context Management Module.

This module will be responsible for finding, loading, preparing, and managing
the context data provided to the LLM.
Functions like find_latest_context_dir, prepare_context_parts, _load_files_from_dir,
find_latest_manifest_json, load_manifest, and the logic for preliminary context
selection (prompt_user_on_empty_selection, confirm_and_modify_selection, etc.)
from llm_interact.py will be moved here.
"""
# Context management functions will be implemented here in subsequent refactoring steps.
