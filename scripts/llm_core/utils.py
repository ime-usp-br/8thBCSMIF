LLM Core General Utilities Module.

This module will house generic utility functions that are not specific to
Git, I/O, API, context, or prompts, but are helpful across the LLM scripts.
Functions like command_exists, suggest_install, and run_command (if not
placed in a more global project utility module) from llm_interact.py
could be moved here.
"""
# General utility functions will be implemented here in subsequent refactoring steps.
