LLM Core Configuration Module.

This module will store all global constants for the LLM interaction scripts,
such as project paths (PROJECT_ROOT), template directories (TEMPLATE_DIR),
base directory for context files (CONTEXT_DIR_BASE), LLM API model names,
delimiters, etc. These constants will be moved from llm_interact.py.
"""
# Constants will be moved here from llm_interact.py in subsequent refactoring steps.
from pathlib import Path

# Example of a constant that would be defined here:
# PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent # Adjust based on actual location
