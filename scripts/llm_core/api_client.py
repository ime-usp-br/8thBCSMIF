"""
LLM Core API Client Module.

This module will encapsulate all interactions with the LLM API (e.g., Google Gemini).
It will manage client initialization, API key rotation, and the execution of API calls.
Functions like initialize_genai_client, rotate_api_key_and_reinitialize,
and execute_gemini_call from llm_interact.py will be moved here.
"""
# API client functions will be implemented here in subsequent refactoring steps.
