LLM Core Git Utilities Module.

This module will contain utility functions related to Git operations
that might be needed by various LLM tasks, such as getting the current branch
or checking for new commits. Functions like get_current_branch and
check_new_commits from llm_interact.py (if used by multiple tasks)
will be moved here.
"""
# Git utility functions will be implemented here in subsequent refactoring steps.
