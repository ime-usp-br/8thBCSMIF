# 8th BCSMIF
The Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo (IME-USP) is announcing  the Eighth Brazilian Conference on Statistical Modeling in Insurance and Finance  (8th BCSMIF) to be held from September 28 to October 3, 2025 at the Maresias Beach Hotel in Maresias, SP.

The 8th BCSMIF objective is to provide a forum for presenting cutting-edge research on the development, implementation of recent methods in the field of Finance and Insurance, with emphasize on the practical applications of Data Science and Machine Learning. 

The 8th BCSMIF also seeks to promote discussion and the exchange of ideas between young researchers and senior scientists. Traditionally, the event  involves graduate students to facilitate their integration into the academic and scientific environment. All speakers are invited to include relevant examples in their presentations.

The 8th BCSMIF is open to academic and non-academic communities, including universities, insurance companies, banks, consulting firms, and government agencies. The conference aims to foster cooperation between professionals and researchers in the field. The official language is English. 

Two satellite workshops will be held before 8th BCSMIF:

Risk Analysis and Applications is a satellite workshop to the 8-th Brazilian Conference on Stochastic Modeling in Insurance and Finance. It will be held for two days of the week that precedes the Conference. It will be focused on the Risk Analysis that is one of the Conference topics.

The program will feature approximately 8 plenary lectures on Risk Analysis and closely related topics, software presentations, a round table, a poster session, and a mini course at the level appropriate for undergraduate students.

Researchers, practitioners, undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate and are welcome to contribute with their expertise to the software presentations and the round table discussions as well as to present their current research work and/or problems in the form of posters.

The Workshop aims to provide a platform for presenting cutting-edge research on the development and  implementation of multivariate dependency models and their applications in finance and actuarial science. It will also serve as a forum for discussing both national and international issues of professional interest. The event is specifically designed to promote collaboration between researchers and industry professionals in these fields, while fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas between emerging researchers and experts with established experience and global recognition.

The program will feature approximately 10 plenary lectures on multivariate statistical models and their applications, alongside a mini-course. The topics will be presented at a level suitable for graduate students. In addition to the Short course, there will be software sessions and poster presentations, with an estimated 35 posters showcasing recent research. Brazilian researchers are strongly encouraged to participate, as they will have the opportunity to receive valuable feedback, suggestions, and critiques from high-level international experts.
